# 3 Summary and Outlook

Through the previous lessons, you have gained an in-depth understanding of the development and improvement process of large language models (LLMs) applications by building and progressively optimizing a Q&A bot.
The following are several key points:

1. **Easy to launch, hard to improve**: Although it is relatively simple to develop and launch LLMs applications, achieving good results requires continuous investment and a deep understanding of the business. It is very important to work with domain experts to establish objective evaluation methods and efficient evaluation mechanisms.

2. **Step-by-step optimization, continuous iteration**: There are various ways to improve the effectiveness of LLMs applications, including optimizing prompts, using RAG chatbot, adding tools, and fine-tuning. It is recommended to first try low-cost methods such as prompt optimization or RAG before considering more complex operations like fine-tuning.

3. **Multi-agent collaboration, complementary strengths**: LLMs possess human-like reasoning capabilities, and building a agent system may be more efficient and powerful than relying on a single LLM.

4. **Production-oriented, focus on practicality**: As with traditional computer systems, it is also important to pay attention to non-functional aspects such as system performance, cost, stability, and security during the development process.

Although we started with building RAG to learn about LLMs applications, the actual application of LLMs goes far beyond this.


## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª 1. Hands-on Experience: Building More Complex AI Applications

To give you hands-on experience with specific AI application scenarios, we highly recommend that you try out the following AI technical solutions. These solutions cover multiple areas from data extraction to content creation, customer service system construction, and real-time audio-video interaction.

### 1.1 Multimodal Data Information Extraction

Imagine you have ten thousand clothing product images and need to extract certain information (e.g., patterns, collar styles). Manual labeling would be time-consuming and labor-intensive. Now, you can use visual understanding LLMs to automate this task.

## üåè 2. AI is Impacting Thousands of Industries

AI and large language models (LLMs) have successfully landed in many fields. The following cases cover healthcare, entertainment, education, and more. By understanding these real-world applications, you can not only intuitively feel the powerful capabilities of AI technology but also draw inspiration to find innovative breakthroughs and practical solutions for your industry.


### 2.1 Healthcare: Assisted Diagnosis and Health Management
In the healthcare field, innovations involving AI and large language models (LLMs)s are emerging endlessly. Alibaba Cloud has collaborated with [AstraZeneca](http://www.djkpai.com/ai/177960.jhtml), integrating massive medical knowledge literature and healthcare data to enable large language models (LLMs)s to generate adverse drug reaction reports, improving pharmaceutical R&D efficiency. DAMO Academy's healthcare AI team developed a large-scale assisted diagnosis system called ["DAMO Medical Vision"](https://www.xinhuanet.com/tech/20240223/ba113561f9974296aca94089befed8e1/c.html) in 2020. It can quickly and accurately diagnose suspected COVID-19 cases by analyzing patients' CT images within just 20 seconds, with an accuracy rate exceeding 96%. Additionally, Alibaba has cooperated with multiple hospitals, significantly enhancing the screening efficiency of lung diseases through its AI system, reducing image analysis time from hours to mere minutes.

> Note: AI recommendations and AI prescriptions are only supplementary information. Medical decisions should be made by professional doctors based on the patient‚Äôs actual condition.


### 2.2 Entertainment Industry: Content Creation and Virtual Idols
The entertainment industry is another important field benefiting from large language models (LLMs) technology. Li Li is a virtual idol driven by deep AI integration technology, capable of seamlessly blending with live-action scenes, showcasing high realism and anthropomorphism. Li Li appeared in the popular TV series *Yi Ren Zhi Xia* and was showcased at the 2023 World Internet Conference in Wuzhen in holographic interactive form, attracting significant attention. Moreover, continuous innovation in digital human technology enables real-time interaction through AI-driven methods such as virtual anchors and digital employees, helping brands create unique live streaming scenarios and marketing activities.

<img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01DOzYDY1XFxeJLeuYL_!!6000000002895-2-tps-956-1698.png" height="400" style="box-shadow: rgba(99, 99, 99, 0.21) 0px 1px 8px 0px;"><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01G7AOmz1RNqmIbhEdd_!!6000000002100-2-tps-864-1437.png" height="400" style="box-shadow: rgba(99, 99, 99, 0.21) 0px 1px 8px 0px;"><img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01PH880m1cG1mojjo6L_!!6000000003572-2-tps-1404-1868.png" height="400" style="box-shadow: rgba(99, 99, 99, 0.21) 0px 1px 8px 0px;">

> Virtual YouTuber technology (Vtuber) involves multiple fields, and with the support of multimodal large language models (LLMs)s, virtual anchors are becoming a reality.


### 2.3 Education Sector: Personalized Learning and Intelligent Tutoring
In the education sector, large language models (LLMs)s have also demonstrated enormous potential. [Precision Study](https://www.91jzx.cn/) has developed an intelligent tutoring system called [Hyper-Realistic AI One-on-One Teacher](https://news.qq.com/rain/a/20240921A03V7N00) based on Alibaba's Tongyi large language models (LLMs)s, providing students with personalized learning plans. The system can automatically adjust teaching content and difficulty based on students‚Äô progress and weak points, ensuring each student receives the most suitable educational resources. Furthermore, Precision Study, in collaboration with DingTalk and Qwen, launched a Hyper-Realistic One-on-One AI Teacher Inclusiveness Program, which will provide AI tutoring resources to remote areas and disadvantaged groups, further promoting inclusive education.

<img src="https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i4/O1CN01Aio9W11Dzx6feTbqT_!!6000000000288-2-tps-3438-1842.png" width="700" style="box-shadow: rgba(99, 99, 99, 0.21) 0px 1px 8px 0px;">

> AI-powered personalized tutoring has broad application prospects, whether in assisting teacher research or providing 24/7 academic assistance. AI applications are influencing people's educational philosophies and teaching methods.

## üéì 3. Continuous Exploration

Technological research and development always excite tech professionals, who constantly push boundaries and collectively drive technological frontiers. Today, the application of large language models (LLMs)s is sparking wave after wave of technological trends globally. Just recently, DeepSeek-R1 made headlines on global leaderboards, while the advent of Manus AI has pushed intelligent agent research to new heights.

We hope this course serves as a starting point for you to continue exploring the infinite possibilities of large language models (LLMs). Continuously improve yourself through practice, create more applications that combine social value with commercial value, and join global developers in writing a new chapter in artificial intelligence!

### 3.1 Further Reading: Deep Thinking Model QwQ
QwQ is a strong reasoning-capable AI model trained based on the Qwen2.5 series, available in both commercial and open-source versions. The commercial version (e.g., qwq-plus) significantly boosts performance in mathematics, coding, and general tasks via reinforcement learning, with core metrics comparable to the full version of DeepSeek-R1, offering stable and latest snapshot versions. The open-source version (e.g., qwq-32b) performs equally well, surpassing similar distilled models. The model supports ultra-long contexts (131,072 tokens) and multi-round conversation functionality, enabling continuous exchange scenarios but does not support tool invocation or structured output. The model design emphasizes reasoning effects, making it suitable for applications requiring deep thinking and high-quality responses.

You can experience the QwQ series models on Bailian [here](https://bailian.console.aliyun.com/#/efm/model_experience_center/text?currentTab=textChat&modelId=qwq-plus-latest), or visit the Alibaba Cloud Help Center for [more information](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/user-guide/qwq).
