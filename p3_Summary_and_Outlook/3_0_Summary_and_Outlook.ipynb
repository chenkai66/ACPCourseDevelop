        "QwQ is a powerful reasoning AI model based on the Qwen2.5, available in both commercial and open-source versions. The commercial model (such as qwq-plus) significantly enhances performance in mathematics, coding, and general tasks through reinforcement learning, with core metrics comparable to the full version of DeepSeek-R2, offering both stable and latest snapshot versions. The open-source version (such as qwq-32b) also performs exceptionally well, surpassing similar distilled models. The model supports ultra-long contexts (131,072 tokens) and multi-round conversation, enabling continuous interaction scenarios, but does not support tool calling or structutred output. Its design focuses on reasoning effectiveness, making it suitable for applications requiring deep thinking and high-quality responses.",
