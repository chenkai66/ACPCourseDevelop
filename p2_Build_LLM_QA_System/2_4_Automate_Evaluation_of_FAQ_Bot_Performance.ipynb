        "What Why Evaluate the latest models. New model generations are likely to have improved features and quality - but may also incur higher costs. Evaluate them for impact, then make migration decisions. Separate instructions & context Check if your model/provider defines delimiters to distinguish instructions, primary and secondary content more clearly. This can help models assign weights more accurately to tokens. Be specific and clear Give more details about the desired context, outcome, length, format, style etc. This will improve both the quality and consistency of responses. Capture recipes in reusable templates. Be descriptive, use examples Models may respond better to a \"show and tell\" approach. Start with a zero-shot approach where you give it an instruction (but no examples) then try few-shot as a refinement, providing a few examples of the desired output. Use analogies. Use cues to jumpstart completions Nudge it towards a desired outcome by giving it some leading words or phrases that it can use as a starting point for the response. Double Down Sometimes you may need to repeat yourself to the model. Give instructions before and after your primary content, use an instruction and a cue, etc. Iterate & validate to see what works. Order Matters The order in which you present information to the model may impact the output, even in the learning examples, thanks to recency bias. Try different options to see what works best. Give the model an ‚Äúout‚Äù Give the model a fallback completion response it can provide if it cannot complete the task for any reason. This can reduce chances of models generating false or fabricated responses.",
