However, the current Q&A bot still has certain limitations. This chapter will guide you in uncovering these shortcomings and introduce the application of agent (Agent) to address these issues. These agent are based on large language models (LLMs) and can extend the capabilities of LLMs, akin to equipping the brain with limbs.",

Suppose you need to perform content validation on a webpage‚Äînot just checking static content, but also interacting with page elements. At this point, the advantages of a multi-agent system become apparent. Through division of labor and cooperation, multiple agents can efficiently complete tasks together without requiring manual intervention at each step.",

        "",
        "##### Integration of Visual Annotations in Agent Applications",
        "In practical projects, especially those involving webpage content interaction, relying solely on traditional text analysis capabilities often cannot accurately identify interface elements, leading to decreased execution efficiency and accuracy of agents. To address this issue, visual annotations are applied to automated testing and element recognition in console interfaces.",
        "",
        "In some scenarios, when agents operate console interfaces, due to the complexity of interface elements, models may struggle to accurately identify targets. By introducing visual annotation technology, the model's understanding and operation accuracy of interface elements can be improved.",
        "",
        "Just like when you use software, you may need to visually identify buttons, drop-down menus, or forms to make the correct operation. Without clear visual identifiers, you might select the wrong location or perform incorrect actions. Similarly, accurate identification of interface elements is crucial for agents during task execution. Through visual annotations, the system can \"tag\" these elements, helping agents \"see\" them more accurately and execute operations correctly.",
        "",
        "For example, when performing automated testing on HTML pages, by using visual annotations, the system can label buttons, links, or forms on the page and guide agents to precisely select and operate these elements. This visually enhanced design significantly improves the model's ability to handle complex interfaces, making multi-agent systems more flexible and efficient when dealing with various UI elements.",

        "##### Flexibility and Technical Integration of Multi-Agent Systems",
        "Through this case, you can see that the design of multi-agent systems is not limited to a specific type of technology or scenario. Although visual annotations were combined with multi-agent systems in this example, the flexibility of multi-agent systems enables them to integrate with various technologies to meet different needs.",
        "",
        "For instance, you can combine machine learning technology to optimize the decision-making process of agents, or use image processing technology to enhance the recognition capability of interface elements.",

        "You can freely choose the architecture and technical combination of multi-agent systems based on your requirements, ultimately bringing you the best automation solution.",
        "",
        "A multi-agent system is not only a tool but also a way of thinking, capable of flexibly designing and adjusting according to different tasks and scenarios, thereby delivering significant value across various applications. In future applications, whether facing automated webpage testing or handling more complex business processes, a well-designed multi-agent system can help improve efficiency, optimize operations, and even replace some human work, freeing up productivity.",
