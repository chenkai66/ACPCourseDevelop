        "In the previous lessons, you have already mastered methods to improve the performance of Q&A bots by optimizing prompts and retrieval processes. However, the current Q&A bot still has certain limitations. This chapter will guide you in uncovering these shortcomings and introduce the application of agent to address these issues. These agent are based on large language models (LLMs) and can extend the capabilities of LLMs, akin to equipping the brain with limbs.\n",

Just as drawing a map requires determining the destination first, when building a Q&A bot, you also need to clearly define the core goals of the task.\n",

        "- Converting natural language questions provided by users into corresponding SQL query statements (i.e., NL2SQL, natural language to SQL).\n",

        "- Returning the query results as the output of the tool function to the user.\n",

        "## 4. Multi-Agent Orchestration Functionality of the Large Language Model Platform\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous section, you learned about the design philosophy and implementation methods of the Multi-Agent system. While building such a system independently offers flexibility, it also introduces complexity and development effort. For many organizations, being able to rapidly implement complex business logic is crucial.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both **Dify** and **Model Studio** provide powerful platforms for developing and orchestrating multi-agent systems, each with its own unique strengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "[Dify](https://Dify.ai) is widely recognized as one of the pioneers in agent workflow canvases. With Dify‚Äôs visual canvas tool, users can design and manage agent task execution logic using intuitive flowcharts. Its user-friendly interface has set a benchmark in the industry and has inspired many developers globally.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Model Studio**, on the other hand, offers an enterprise-grade environment for building intelligent agent systems powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a visual, canvas-based orchestration tool that enables users to:\n",
        "- **Define Execution Logic**: Configure rules and logic chains visually and intuitively.\n",
        "- **Coordinate Agent Collaboration**: Design modular workflows where agents autonomously communicate and collaborate.\n",
        "- **Validate Quickly**: Simulate and test agent interactions to ensure the system behaves as expected.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of Model Studio‚Äôs key advantages lies in its deep integration with advanced LLM capabilities, enabling autonomous decision-making and dynamic task allocation. This makes it especially well-suited for enterprises that need to deploy intelligent, scalable agent systems quickly and efficiently‚Äîwithout requiring deep technical expertise.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, Model Studio's built-in tools support end-to-end development, from prototyping to deployment, making it ideal for teams aiming to accelerate time-to-market while maintaining high levels of flexibility and control.\n",

        "In this lesson, you have learned the following content:\n",
        "- The core concept of the Agent system\n",
        "- The construction principles and implementation methods of multi-agent systems\n",
        "- Multi-agent orchestration of large language model platforms\n",
        "\n",
        "### Further Reading\n",
        "You have already learned how to use multi-agent systems to handle complex tasks, but this design is not limited to basic operations. In fact, properly designing a multi-agent system can help automate more complex business processes, improving efficiency and accuracy, and even handling tedious operations that usually require human intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Effect Demonstration and Flowchart Analysis\n",
        "Below is an actual application case of an agent system. Suppose you need to perform content validation on a webpage‚Äînot just checking static content, but also interacting with page elements. At this point, the advantages of a multi-agent system become apparent. Through division of labor and cooperation, multiple agents can efficiently complete tasks together without requiring manual intervention at each step.\n",
        "\n",
        "<a href=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01tJVWph27j74Ed9szd_!!6000000007832-2-tps-3446-1612.png\" target=\"_blank\">\n",
        "<img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01tJVWph27j74Ed9szd_!!6000000007832-2-tps-3446-1612.png\" alt=\"image\" width=\"700\">\n",
        "</a>\n",
        "\n",
        "When facing a task that requires parsing HTML pages and performing specific actions, the division of labor among multiple agents is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Planner Agent: Decomposes tasks, such as identifying lists or buttons within HTML elements.\n",
        "- Selector Agent: Responsible for specific operational tasks, such as selecting specific elements and executing click actions.\n",
        "- Monitor Agent: Monitors task execution in real time to ensure the process completes as planned, such as verifying whether the correct button was clicked.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Integration of Visual Annotations in Agent Applications\n",
        "In practical projects, especially those involving webpage content interaction, relying solely on traditional text analysis capabilities often cannot accurately identify interface elements, leading to decreased execution efficiency and accuracy of agents. To address this issue, visual annotations are applied to automated testing and element recognition in console interfaces.\n",
        "\n",
        "In some scenarios, when agents operate console interfaces, due to the complexity of interface elements, models may struggle to accurately identify targets. By introducing visual annotation technology, the model's understanding and operation accuracy of interface elements can be improved.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just like when you use software, you may need to visually identify buttons, drop-down menus, or forms to make the correct operation. Without clear visual identifiers, you might select the wrong location or perform incorrect actions. Similarly, accurate identification of interface elements is crucial for agents during task execution. Through visual annotations, the system can \"tag\" these elements, helping agents \"see\" them more accurately and execute operations correctly.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, when performing automated testing on HTML pages, by using visual annotations, the system can label buttons, links, or forms on the page and guide agents to precisely select and operate these elements. This visually enhanced design significantly improves the model's ability to handle complex interfaces, making multi-agent systems more flexible and efficient when dealing with various UI elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Flexibility and Technical Integration of Multi-Agent Systems\n",
        "Through this case, you can see that the design of multi-agent systems is not limited to a specific type of technology or scenario. Although visual annotations were combined with multi-agent systems in this example, the flexibility of multi-agent systems enables them to integrate with various technologies to meet different needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "For instance, you can combine machine learning technology to optimize the decision-making process of agents, or use image processing technology to enhance the recognition capability of interface elements.\n",
        "\n",
        "Alternatively, you can integrate multi-agent systems with natural language processing so that they can understand and generate more complex language instructions, applicable in intelligent customer service or text analysis scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can freely choose the architecture and technical combination of multi-agent systems based on your requirements, ultimately bringing you the best automation solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "A multi-agent system is not only a tool but also a way of thinking, capable of flexibly designing and adjusting according to different tasks and scenarios, thereby delivering significant value across various applications. In future applications, whether facing automated webpage testing or handling more complex business processes, a well-designed multi-agent system can help improve efficiency, optimize operations, and even replace some human work, freeing up productivity.\n",
