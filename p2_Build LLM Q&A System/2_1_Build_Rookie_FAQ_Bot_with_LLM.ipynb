        "You work at an educational content development company, and with the continuous influx of new employees, frequent Q&A demands have led to significant time and resource costs. You decide to use LLMs technology to build a Q&A robot to improve the accuracy and efficiency of responses.\n",

However, as a developer, you often need to integrate LLM capabilities into your own applications. You can use the widely adopted OpenAI Python SDK to call the Qwen-Max LLM. You have already installed the necessary dependencies in `1.0 Computing Environment Setup`. Before executing the following code, confirm that you have switched to the newly created Python environment, such as the `Python (llm_learn)` environment created in this example.\n",
