        "### 4.1 Document Preparation Stage\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional customer service systems, customer service personnel accumulate a knowledge base based on the questions raised by users and share it with other customer service staff for reference. This process is equally indispensable when building a RAG chatbot.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Intent Space**: We can map the needs behind user questions as points, which together form a user intent space.\n",
        "- **Knowledge Space**: The knowledge points you have accumulated in the knowledge base documents constitute a knowledge space. These knowledge points can be a paragraph or a chapter.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we project the intent space and knowledge space together, we find that there are overlaps and differences between the two spaces. These areas correspond to our three subsequent optimization strategies:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Overlapping Area**:\n",
        "   - This refers to parts where user questions can be answered based on the content of the knowledge base, forming the foundation of ensuring the effectiveness of the RAG chatbot.\n",
        "   - For these user intents, you can continuously improve the quality of responses through **optimizing content quality, engineering, and algorithms**.\n",
        "2. **Uncovered Intent Space**:\n",
        "   - Due to the lack of supporting content in the knowledge base, LLMs tend to generate \"hallucination\". For example, if the company has added a new \"Data Analysis Department,\" but there are no related documents in the knowledge base, no matter how much you improve the engineering algorithms, the RAG chatbot will not be able to accurately answer this question.\n",
        "   - What you need to do is proactively **supplement the missing knowledge** and continually track changes in the user intent space.\n",
        "3. **Unused Knowledge Space**:\n",
        "   - Recalling irrelevant knowledge points may interfere with the LLM's responses.\n",
        "   - Therefore, you need to **optimize the recall algorithm** to avoid recalling unrelated content. Additionally, you should periodically check the knowledge base and **remove irrelevant content**.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Before attempting to optimize engineering or algorithms, you should prioritize building a mechanism that continuously collects user intents. By systematically gathering real user needs to enrich the knowledge base content and inviting domain experts with deep understanding of user intents to participate in effect evaluation, a closed-loop optimization process of \"data collection - knowledge update - expert validation\" is formed to ensure the effectiveness of the RAG chatbot.\n",

        "\n",
        "In addition to rewriting a query for clarity, you can also break down complex questions into simpler, sequential steps. This approach is particularly useful when dealing with ambiguous or multi-faceted queries ‚Äî such as identifying information about individuals with common names like \"Michael Johnson.\" By decomposing the original question, you enable the system to retrieve more comprehensive and accurate results.\n",
        "\n",
        "LlamaIndex offers two powerful tools that support this approach:\n",
        "\n",
        "## 1. `StepDecomposeQueryTransform`\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool helps decompose a complex question into multiple sub-questions. It leverages a LLM to analyze the intent behind the query and generate a series of logical follow-up questions that lead to the final answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example:**  \n",
        "For the question *\"Which department does Michael Johnson belong to?\"*, the tool might break it down into:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Step 1:** *\"How many employees named Michael Johnson are there in the company?\"*\n",
        "- **Step 2:** *\"Which departments do these Michael Johnsons belong to?\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "By doing so, the system avoids missing relevant information due to ambiguity and ensures all possible matches are considered.\n",
        "\n",
        "## 2. `MultiStepQueryEngine`\n",
        "\n",
        "This query engine processes each of the sub-questions generated by `StepDecomposeQueryTransform` in sequence. After retrieving answers to each step, it combines the results into a single, coherent response.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Example Workflow:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. First, it retrieves all employees named Michael Johnson.\n",
        "2. Then, it queries the department information for each one.\n",
        "3. Finally, it compiles a response such as (just for illustrative purposes):\n",
        "\n",
        "> *\"There are three Michael Johnsons in the company, working in the Teaching and Research Department, Course Development Department, and IT Department, respectively.\"*\n",
        "\n",
        "This step-by-step processing ensures that no piece of relevant information is overlooked and allows the system to handle complex queries more effectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Benefits of Multi-Step Querying\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Improved Accuracy:** Breaking down queries leads to more thorough retrieval and reduces the risk of missing key details.\n",
        "- **Better Handling of Ambiguity:** Especially useful for queries involving common names or unclear references.\n",
        "- **Logical Flow:** Mimics how humans solve complex problems ‚Äî by dividing them into smaller, manageable parts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Considerations\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Increased LLM Usage:** Since each step may involve calling an LLM, this method consumes more tokens than a single-query approach.\n",
        "- **Longer Processing Time:** Due to multiple sequential calls, the overall response time may be longer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Nonetheless, for complex or ambiguous queries, the trade-off is often worth it in terms of result quality and completeness."

        "\n",
        "Now, the LLM will generate the final answer based on your question and the retrieved content. However, this answer may still not meet your expectations. The issues you might encounter include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. No relevant information was retrieved, and the LLM fabricated an answer.\n",
        "2. Relevant information was retrieved, but the LLM did not generate the answer as required.\n",
        "3. Relevant information was retrieved, and the LLM provided an answer, but you expect the AI to give a more comprehensive response.\n",
        "\n",
        "To address these issues, you can analyze and resolve them from the following perspectives:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Choosing the right LLM:\n",
        "   1. For simple information queries and summaries, a small-parameter model is sufficient to meet the needs, such as [qwen-turbo](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/models#ff492e2c10lub).\n",
        "   2. If you want the Q&A bot to perform complex logical reasoning, it is recommended to choose a larger-parameter LLM with stronger reasoning capabilities, such as [qwen-plus](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/models#bb0ffee88bwnk) or even [Qwen-Max](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/models#cf6cc4aa2aokf).\n",
        "   3. If your question requires reviewing a large number of document fragments, it is recommended to choose a model with a longer context length, such as [qwen-long](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/models#27b2b3a15d5c6), [qwen-turbo](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/models#ff492e2c10lub), or [qwen-plus](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/models#bb0ffee88bwnk).\n",
        "   4. If the RAG chatbot you are building is for non-general domains such as the legal field, it is recommended to use a model trained specifically for that domain, such as [Tongyi Farei](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/getting-started/models#f0436273ef1xm).\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Fully optimize the prompt template, for example:\n",
        "   1. Clearly request no fabrication of answers: LLMs may produce some inaccurate content, commonly referred to as hallucination. You can reduce the likelihood of LLM hallucinations by requiring in the prompt: \"If the provided information is insufficient to answer the question, please explicitly state 'Based on the available information, I cannot answer this question.' Do not fabricate answers.\"\n",
        "   2. Add content delimiters: If the retrieved document slices are randomly mixed into the prompt, it will be difficult for humans to see the structure of the entire prompt, and the LLM will also be affected. It is recommended to clearly separate the prompt and the retrieved slices so that the LLM can correctly understand your intent.\n",
        "   3. Adjust the template according to the type of question: Different types of questions may require different response paradigms. You can use the LLM to identify the question type and then map different prompt templates accordingly. For example, for some questions, you may want the LLM to first output the overall framework and then the details; for other questions, you may prefer the LLM to provide concise conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Adjust the parameters of the LLM, for example:\n",
        "   1. If you want the LLM to produce the same output for the same question, you can pass the same seed value each time the model is invoked.\n",
        "   2. If you want the LLM to avoid always using repetitive sentences when answering user questions, you can appropriately increase the presence_penalty value.\n",
        "   3. If you are querying factual content, you can appropriately decrease the temperature or top_p values; conversely, when querying creative content, you can appropriately increase their values.\n",
        "   4. If you need to limit the word count (such as generating summaries or keywords), control costs, or reduce response time, you can appropriately lower the max_tokens value. However, if max_tokens is too low, it may lead to truncated output. Conversely, when generating long text, you can increase its value.\n",
        "   5. You can also refer to the [Qwen API Reference](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/use-qwen-by-calling-api) to learn more about the usage instructions for various parameters."

        "\n",
        "Through the previous learning, you have understood the workflow of a simple RAG and common optimization techniques. You can also combine the knowledge you've learned with actual needs to route different questions to different RAG chatbots, thereby building a more powerful modular RAG chatbot. Additionally, through the previous lessons, you should also realize that LLMs are not only useful for building question-answering systems. Leveraging LLMs to identify user intent and extract structured information (such as extracting tags from user questions as mentioned earlier) can also play a role in many other application scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "Of course, the optimization methods for RAG go far beyond those introduced in this course. The industry continues to research and explore RAG, and there are still many advanced RAG topics worth your study. From the previous learning, it is clear that building a well-rounded and high-performing RAG chatbot is not simple. In practical work, you may need to seize business opportunities more quickly and won't have time to delve into these details. Below are some directions worth exploring:\n",
        "\n",
        "* GraphRAG technology ingeniously combines the advantages of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and query-focused summarization (QFS), providing a powerful solution for handling large-scale text data. It merges the strengths of both technologies: RAG excels at finding precise detailed information, while QFS is better at understanding and summarizing the overall content of an article. Through this combination, GraphRAG can accurately answer specific questions and handle complex queries that require deeper understanding, making it particularly suitable for building intelligent question-answering systems. \n",
        "  If you want to delve deeper into how to practically apply GraphRAG, you can refer to the detailed tutorial provided by LlamaIndex: [Building a GraphRAG Application with LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/cookbooks/GraphRAG_v2/).\n",

        "\n",
        "* If your business processes are more complex, you can also leverage [Visual Workflow, agent orchestration application](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/user-guide/application-introduction) on Model Studio to build a more powerful application.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Meanwhile, Model Studio also provides a series of [LlamaIndex components](https://help.aliyun.com/zh/model-studio/developer-reference/llamaindex/), allowing you to make full use of Model Studio capabilities while continuing to use the familiar LlamaIndex API to build RAG chatbots.  \n",
