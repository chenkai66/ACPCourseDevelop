        "### üöÑ Preface\n",
        "\n",
        "The new Q&A bot may encounter some issues during real-world use, especially when users ask specific questions that require detailed knowledge from internal documents. For example, when a new employee asks, \"How do I request leave?\" the bot might provide a generic response instead of consulting the company‚Äôs official policy documents for accurate guidance.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just as conventional software development requires testing and validation, it is equally important to establish an¬†**evaluation system**¬†for your Q&A bot project. This ensures that similar issues can be quickly identified and resolved. Moreover, after implementing any optimization or improvement, you should run a batch of test questions to confirm that the changes positively impact  the overall performance of the Q&A bot.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this chapter, you will learn how to¬†**automate evaluation processes**¬†using LLMs and specialized frameworks like¬†**Ragas**, enabling you to measure both the quality of answers and the effectiveness of retrieval.\n",

        "- Understand how to automate evaluations for LLM applications.\n",
        "- Evaluate RAG chatbots using automated tools such as Ragas.\n",

        "In this chapter, we will first understand some current issues with RAG chatbot through a specific problem. Then, we will attempt to discover the issue by implementing a simple automated test ourselves. Finally, we will learn how to use the more mature RAG application testing framework, Ragas, to assess the performance of RAG chatbot.\n",

        "\n",
        "Intuitively, the scoring of Answer Correctness aligns with your expectations. The scoring process involves using an LLM (in the code¬†`llm=Tongyi(model_name=\"qwen-plus\"))` and an embedding model (in the code¬†`embeddings=DashScopeEmbeddings(model=\"text-embedding-v3\"))` to calculate the result based on ¬†**semantic similarity**¬†and¬†**factual accuracy**¬†between the answer and the ground truth.\n",
        "\n",
        "##### Semantic Similarity\n",
        "Semantic similarity is determined by generating text vectors for both the answer and the ground truth using the embedding model. These vectors are then compared using methods like cosine similarity, which is the most commonly used in Ragas, along with Euclidean distance and Manhattan distance. \n",

        "##### Factual Accuracy\n",

        "\n",
        "### 3.1 Context recall\n",
        "This metric evaluates the **retrieval** phase of your RAG application. A low context recall score indicates that the retrieved contexts do not cover enough relevant information from the ground truth.If this metric has a low score, you can try optimizing from the following aspects:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Check the Knowledge Base**\n",

        "\n",
        "    The knowledge base is the source of a RAG application. If the content within it is incomplete or insufficient, it can lead to inadequate reference information being retrieved, which directly impacts context recall‚Äîthe ability of the system to retrieve relevant information that supports accurate and meaningful answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "    To ensure the knowledge base is comprehensive and effective, you can:\n",
        "\n",
        "    * Compare the knowledge base content with test samples to verify whether the information in the knowledge base is sufficient to support each query.\n",
        "    * Use LLMs to assist in this process: By prompting the model to evaluate whether the knowledge base contains the necessary information to answer a given question, you can identify gaps or inconsistencies.\n",
        "\n",
        "    If you find that some test samples lack relevant information in the knowledge base, it‚Äôs essential to supplement the knowledge base with additional data. This ensures that the RAG system has access to the most accurate and complete information, improving both retrieval quality and answer reliability.\n",

A high-quality embedding model can better capture the deep semantic meaning of text, allowing for more accurate and meaningful similarity comparisons between queries and retrieved content.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the following:\n",

To address this, you can design a prompt template by organizing common employee questions and use LLMs to rewrite the queries, improving the accuracy of the retrieval process.\n",

A low context precision score suggests that while some relevant information may be retrieved, it is mixed with irrelevant or less important content, reducing the effectiveness of the retrieval.\n",
        "\n",
        "If this metric has a low score, you can apply the same optimization measures used for context recall, such as improving the knowledge base or refining the retrieval algorithm.

        "The answer correctness metric evaluates the overall comprehensive performance of a RAG system. If this metric has a low score while the previous two metrics have high scores, it indicates that the RAG system performs well in the **retrieval** phase but encounters issues in the **generation** phase. You can try the methods learned in previous tutorials, such as optimizing prompts, adjusting hyperparameters (such as temperature) of LLMs generation, or replacing with a more powerful LLMs, and even fine-tuning the LLMs (which will be introduced in later tutorials) to enhance the accuracy of generated answers."

        "Automated testing is a crucial tool for engineering optimization. With quantified metrics, it  helps you move from¬†intuitive improvements to data-driven evaluations, ensuring that your RAG chatbot performs better after each enhancement. This not only allows you to evaluate the question-answering quality more efficiently and identify areas for improvement but also enables you to quantify the results of your optimizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "While automated testing is powerful, it does not eliminate the need for human evaluation entirely. In practical applications, it is recommended to involve domain experts who can help build a test set that reflects real-world scenarios. These experts can ensure the test set covers a wide range of typical queries and edge cases, and it should be continuously updated to reflect evolving needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, since LLMs are not always 100% accurate, it‚Äôs advisable to regularly sample and review the results of automated testing in real-world use. Avoid frequently changing the LLM or embedding models unless necessary, as this can introduce instability. For Ragas, you can improve its performance by adjusting the default prompts‚Äîfor example, by adding domain-specific reference examples that align with your business context.
