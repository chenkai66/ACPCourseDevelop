# 2.0 Project Background

In this chapter, you will begin the first project of this course.
You work for an educational content development company. With the continuous influx of new employees, frequent Q&A demands have led to significant time and resource costs.

To address this issue, the company has compiled a comprehensive document library covering company regulations, writing standards, daily tool usage guides, and more. New employees can now independently consult these materials to obtain the information they need.

After some time, the company found that the new employees' work did not comply with the rules and regulations, and errors occurred frequently.
Upon analysis, it turned out that there was too much information in the document library, making it difficult for new employees to read and digest it comprehensively.

To further solve this problem, the company developed a Q&A system. The system is configured with high-frequency employee questions, allowing employees to ask questions independently.

After the Q&A system had been running for some time, it was observed that the volume of employee inquiries and work errors had not significantly decreased.
The company leadership realized that the current Q&A system had many limitations. Primarily, the system's mechanism was based on fixed rules and similarity judgments, which meant that when employees used different phrasing, the system might fail to answer the question.
Additionally, the workload of manually configuring Q&A pairs was substantial, resulting in a low return on investment.

In response to this situation, the company leadership decided to assign you to take charge of this matter, hoping to resolve the issue thoroughly.
After conducting research, you plan to leverage the most advanced large language models (LLMs) technology to build an intelligent Q&A application. The intelligent application based on LLMs does not require configuring Q&A pairs. It can understand human language well and accurately answer questions based on the companyâ€™s knowledge base, effectively reducing employee inquiries and improving work efficiency.

Next, you will start implementing this goal.
