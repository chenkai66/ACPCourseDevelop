        "## 1. How RAG Works\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG works by providing reference materials to LLMs, similar to an open-book exam. If a model has not seen certain knowledge points during training, directly asking it related questions may result in inaccurate answers. However, if relevant knowledge is provided as a reference, the quality of the LLM's responses will significantly improve.\n",
        "\n",
        "RAG is a solution that provides reference materials for LLMs. RAG applications typically consist of two parts: **indexing** and **retrieval generation**.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.1 Indexing\n",
        "Indexing involves preparing reference materials for efficient retrieval. It's much like marking pages in a book so you can find the information you need during the exam. Indexing includes four steps:<br>\n",
        "1. **Document Parsing**<br>\n",
        "Converting documents into a textual format that an LLM can understand.\n",
        "2. **Text Chunking**<br>\n",
        "Segmenting parsed documents into smaller chunks for faster retrieval.\n",
        "3. **Text Embedding**<br>\n",
        "Using embedding models to digitally represent both the question and the paragraphs, then comparing their similarity to find the most relevant content.<br>\n",
        "    > If you're interested in the details of this process, you can explore the extended reading section of this tutorial.\n",
        "4. **Index Storage**<br>\n",
        "Storing vectorized content in a database to avoid repeating the process each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "    <img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i3/O1CN01h0y0Uy1WH30Q7FRDJ_!!6000000002762-2-tps-1592-503.png\" width=\"1000\"><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "    After indexing, RAG applications can retrieve relevant text segments based on user questions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1.2 Retrieval Generation\n",
        "RAG includes two stages:¬†`Retrieval`¬†and¬†`Generation`.¬†<br>\n",
        "1. **Retrieval**<br>\n",
        "The retrieval phase recalls the most relevant text segments. Continuing the open-book test analogy, it's like searching for the answer in your textbook. The question is vectorized using an embedding model, and semantic similarity is compared with the paragraphs in the vector database to identify the most relevant ones. Retrieval is the most critical part of a RAG application. Imagine finding the wrong material during an exam‚Äîyour answer would be inaccurate. To improve retrieval accuracy, besides using powerful embedding models, techniques like reranking and sentence window retrieval can be applied.\n",
        "2. **Generation**<br>\n",
        "After you've found the  information you're looking for, it's time to apply it so that it answers the question.Similarly, after retrieving relevant text segments, the RAG application generates the final prompt by combining the question and the retrieved text segments through a prompt template. The LLM then generates the response, leveraging its summarization abilities rather than relying solely on its internal knowledge.\n",
        "    > A typical prompt template is: `Please answer the user's question based on the following information: {retrieved text segments}. The user's question is: {question}.`\n",
        "\n",
        "    <img src=\"https://img.alicdn.com/imgextra/i2/O1CN01cA2SmX1ociqCTwjys_!!6000000005246-2-tps-2719-703.png\" width=\"600\"><br>"

        "A complete RAG application typically involves two main phases: index building and retrieval generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The index building phase includes four steps: document parsing, text segmentation, text vectorization, and index storage.\n",
        "* The retrieval generation phase consists of two steps: retrieval and generation.\n",

        "2. **Creating a RAG application**<br>\n",
        "Using the highly integrated tools provided by LlamaIndex, you built a RAG application, and learned how to save and load indexes. You also gained knowledge on implementing multi-round conversation within a RAG application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the RAG chatbot can already answer questions like \"What tools should our company use for project management?\" quite well, its current functionality is still quite basic. In upcoming tutorials, we will explore ways to expand the capabilities of the RAG chatbot. The next section will focus on improving the quality of the RAG chatbot's responses through prompt optimization.\n"

        "#### Text Vectorization\n",
        "Computers cannot directly understand the similarity between two sentences such as \"I like  apples\" and \"I love apples.\" However, they can understand the similarity between two numerical vectors of the same dimension, usually using cosine similarity. \n",
        "\n",
        "Text vectorization converts natural language into numerical forms that computers can process, using embedding models. These models are trained using a technique called¬†contrastive learning, where the input data consists of many text pairs (s1, s2), each labeled as  related or unrelated. The model's goal is to maximize the similarity of related text pairs  and minimize the  similarity between those of unrelated  pairs.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the¬†indexing¬†phase, after text segmentation produces n chunks (such as [c1, c2, c3, ..., cn]), an embedding model converts them into corresponding vectors ([v1, v2, v3, ..., vn]), which are then stored in a vector database.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the¬†retrieval¬†phase, when a user asks a question q, the embedding model converts it into a vector vq. It then finds the n most similar vectors to vq in the vector database (this number can be adjusted as needed). Through the relationship between these vectors and their corresponding text segments, the relevant text segments are retrieved as search results."
