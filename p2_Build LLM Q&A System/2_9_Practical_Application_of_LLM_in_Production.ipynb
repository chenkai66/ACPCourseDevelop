        "* Multimodal tasks: Combining multiple modalities such as text, images, video, and speech to handle complex tasks. It is recommended to use specially designed multimodal models (e.g., Qwen-VL), which can significantly improve efficiency and consistency. Simply combining multiple single-modality models (e.g., speech recognition + text generation + image understanding) to complete multimodal tasks can lead to higher overall latency, poor consistency, and increased development complexity in the application.\n",

This is like a 24-hour convenience store where you can always shop normally no matter when you visit.

        "1. **Establishing a Baseline Model**\n",
        "    * **Start Simple**: Use basic algorithms (e.g., decision trees) or predefined rules (e.g., keyword matching) as the initial model to quickly validate feasibility. For instance, in a customer service system, use \"keyword matching\" to determine user queries, with 70% accuracy as the baseline. Subsequent optimizations must exceed this threshold.\n",

        "2. **Regular Testing and Comparison**\n",
        "    * **Time Dimension**: Regularly (e.g., weekly) test old and new models with the latest data to prevent performance degradation. For example, if the click-through rate of an e-commerce recommendation system falls below the baseline, adjustments are needed.\n",
        "    * **Scenario Dimension**: Establish multiple baselines for different situations (e.g., peak promotional periods, different regions) to comprehensively assess stability.\n",

        "    * **Automatic Blocking of Unqualified Models**: Incorporate baseline testing into the deployment process to block versions that do not meet standards.\n",

        "- **Improving model inference efficiency with multi-GPU Prefill/Decode separation**: In the inference process of LLMs, Prefill (prefill phase) and Decode (decoding phase) are two key stages, corresponding to input processing and output generation. In a multi-GPU environment, separating Prefill and Decode processes can optimize the model's inference speed, thereby meeting SLO requirements for TTFT (Time to First Token) and TPOT (Time Per Output Token). [DistServe](https://github.com/LLMServe/DistServe) is a typical system implementation that separates Prefill/Decode, combining chunked prefill and asynchronous pipelines to significantly increase throughput and reduce latency.\n",
        "- **Implementing multimodal security reviews**: Expanding video compliance detection workflows by integrating custom sensitive word libraries and copyright recognition.\n",
        "- **Introducing MLOps to manage AI systems**: MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) combines machine learning and DevOps, aiming to manage the entire lifecycle of machine learning models through automation, standardization, and collaboration. It draws on DevOps concepts from software engineering, tightly integrating development (Development) and operations (Operations) to ensure that machine learning models can efficiently transition from the development stage to the production environment and continuously optimize and iterate in the production environment.\n",
